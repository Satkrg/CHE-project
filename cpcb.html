        <h2>What is CPCB??</h2>
        <p>
            <B>
            The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India is an organisation under the Government of India responsible for Air and Water Quality Monitoring Services and any other pollution-related issues
        </B>
        </p>
        <p>
            It serves as a field formation and also provides technical services to the Ministry of Environment and Forests
            of the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Principal Functions of the CPCB, as spelt out in the 
            Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981,
            (i) to promote cleanliness of streams and wells in different areas of the States by prevention, control and abatement of
             water pollution, and (ii) to improve the quality of air and to prevent, control or abate air pollution in the country.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Air Quality Monitoring</b> is an important part of the air quality management.
            The National Air Monitoring Programme (NAMP) has been established with objectives to determine the present air
            quality status and trends and to control and regulate pollution from industries and other source to meet the air
            quality standards. It also provides background air quality data needed for industrial siting and towns planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides this, CPCB has an automatic monitoring station at ITO Intersection in New Delhi.
            At this station Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3),
            Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are being
            monitored regularly. This information on Air Quality at ITO is updated every week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Water Quality Monitoring</b> is an important part of the Water quality management.
            Fresh water is a finite resource essential for use in agriculture, industry, propagation of wildlife & 
            fisheries and for human existence. India is a riverine country. It has 14 major rivers, 44 medium rivers 
            and 55 minor rivers besides numerous lakes, ponds and wells which are used as primary source of drinking
            water even without treatment. Most of the rivers being fed by monsoon rains, which is limited to only three 
            months of the year, run dry throughout the rest of the year often carrying wastewater discharges from industries 
            or cities/towns endangering the quality of our scarce water resources. The parliament of India in its wisdom 
            enacted the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 with a view to maintaining and restoring 
            wholesomeness of our water bodies. One of the mandates of CPCB is to collect, collate and disseminate technical 
            and statistical data relating to water pollution. Hence, Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) and Surveillance are of 
            utmost importance.
